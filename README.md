## Overview

Managing both hard-copy and soft-copy documents securely is a challenge faced by individuals and organizations alike. This project proposes a solution that bridges physical document security with cloud accessibility — a roller scanner is integrated into a numpad-locked safe, allowing documents to be scanned and automatically uploaded to Google Drive, while the original hard copy is secured inside the safe.

## Problem Statement

- 19% of a typical work week is spent searching for documents
- Hard-copy documents are difficult to manage securely
- Existing cloud storage solutions don't address physical document security
- No unified system exists to handle both hard-copy storage and soft-copy upload in one step

---

## Solution

A physical security safe with an integrated roller scanner and Arduino-based numpad lock, connected to a web portal that uploads scanned documents directly to the user's Google Drive.

```
User inserts document → Roller scanner scans it
        ↓
Hard copy secured inside the safe (numpad protected)
        ↓
Soft copy sent to device via scanner software
        ↓
User visits web portal → Enters Drive ID → Selects file
        ↓
Document uploaded to Google Drive via Google Apps Script
```

## Software Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS |
| Backend | Google Apps Script (JavaScript-based) |
| Cloud Storage | Google Drive API |
| File formats supported | JPG, JPEG, and other common formats |

---

## Key Features

- Numpad-protected physical safe for hard-copy document security
- Integrated roller scanner for instant digitization
- Web portal for direct Google Drive upload — no manual transfer needed
- End-to-end document flow: physical scan → cloud storage in one process
- User privacy ensured — Drive access restricted to authenticated Gmail ID
- Virtual numpad on web portal adds an additional security layer

---

## Security Design

- Documents accessible only via authenticated Google Drive ID
- OAuth-based Drive access — permission requested on each deployment
- Numpad lock prevents unauthorized physical access
- End-to-end flow ensures no third-party access to documents

---

## Future Scope

- [ ] Full IoT automation — scan and upload without any computer interaction
- [ ] Face ID integration for tracking document access (who accessed, when)
- [ ] Activity log for each document — timestamped access history
- [ ] ISP verification for persistent Drive access without repeated permissions
- [ ] Mobile app for remote monitoring of safe status
- [ ] Support for additional file formats (PDF, PNG, DOCX)
